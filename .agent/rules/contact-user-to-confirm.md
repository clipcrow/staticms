Always contact user if you have any questions about the instructions or
specifications.

- Don't make assumptions and make assumptions about things you don't know.
- Instructions from users are often vague, and it is best to assume that the
  specifications still have many flaws.
- It is encouraged to ask questions about the instructions and specifications.
  Users are willing to provide answers and explanations. I want you to feel
  safe.
